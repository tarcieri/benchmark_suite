= benchmark_suite

* http://github.com/evanphx/benchmark_suite

== DESCRIPTION:

A set of enhancements to the standard library benchmark.rb 

== FEATURES/PROBLEMS:

 * benchmark/ips - benchmarks a blocks iterations/second. For short snippits
   of code, ips automatically figures out how many times to run the code
   to get interesting data. No more guessing at random iteration counts!

 * benchmark - a cli tool for running multiple benchmarks against
   multiple rubies.


== SYNOPSIS:

require 'benchmark/ips'

Benchmark.ips do
  # Typical mode, runs the block as many times as it can
  x.report("addition") { 1 + 2 }

  # To reduce overhead, the number of iterations is passed in
  # and the block must run the code the specific number of times.
  # Used for when the workload is very small and any overhead
  # introduces incorrectable errors.
  x.report("addition2") do |times|
    i = 0
    while i < times
      1 + 2
    end
  end

  # To reduce overhead even more, grafts the code given into
  # the loop that performs the iterations internally to reduce
  # overhead. Typically not needed, use the |times| form instead.
  x.report("addition3", "1 + 2")
end

== REQUIREMENTS:

* ruby-ffi on MRI

== INSTALL:

* gem install benchmark-suite

== DEVELOPERS:
